Hear what your LiDAR is missing.

This repo contains scripts for deploying and self-hosting a MusicBrainz instance
in conjunction with L——'s metadata API.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A hosted `api.musicinfo.pro` instance is provided as a service to the
> community. The software it's running is not my own and I cannot guarantee its
> stability. If you'd like to help improve things please reach out!

To use the hosted instance, change your L—— image to any of the [available
tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/blampe/lidarr/tags).

This L—— image is derived from the upstream linuxserver image, with the
addition of a small nginx proxy responsible for re-directing metadata
queries to `api.musicinfo.pro`.

> [!TIP]
> You might also be interested in
> [rreading-glasses](http://github.com/blampe/rreading-glasses), which takes a
> similar approach with R——.

## Self-hosting

tl;dr: Vanilla MusicBrainz images work just fine with the open-source metadata
server, it's just a little tricky to configure.

> [!WARNING]
> Do **not** use any of the scripts, compose files, or images referenced in the
> L—— metadata source. They are outdated and incompatible with MusicBrainz
> schema changes.

* Deploy [metabrainz-docker](http://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-docker)
  but use a username/password of abc/abc because the metadata server hard-codes
  it. This will require ~350GB and a MetaBrainz replication token. This is the
  hardest part, so make sure you follow the instructions closely.

* Deploy L—— metadata using the example in `deploy/compose` as a guide.

* Setup the L—— metadata server:
  * `psql postgres://abc:abc@localhost/musicbrainz_db -c 'CREATE DATABASE lm_cache_db;'`
  * `psql postgres://abc:abc@localhost/musicbrainz_db -f lidarrmetadata/sql/CreateIndices.sql`

The L—— server will crash repeatedly but seems to eventually stabilize (maybe).
